My first real java project

This project was programmed exclusively by myself during a 2-week project phase as part of my OCA Java SE8 Programmer preparation training. 
The project is not finished.

My main goal was to apply all the various aspects and capabilities of the Java language that we discussed during the course. I also tried out some other things 
that were not part of the course like password encryption, storing an encrypted password on a SQL database and verify login attempts using the stored password etc.

Also I tried to re-use as much code as possible (although I know there is potential for more) and to come up with some sort of application achitecture (using MVC design approach). 
Since I do not have any experience (yet) with this stuff, I might be totally wrong. But it was a great challenge and learning opportunity for me to structure 
such a program and its classes and to come up with some sort of class structure and hierarchy.

I struggled a little with GUIs as I had no prior experience, so coding my GUIs including inheritance of GUI base designs (and making sure everything runs smooth) 
took much more time than anticipated. However, considering the amount of time available for this project, I was happy that I made this work.

Please feel free to leave any comments / suggestions.

I am currently not continuing to work on this project.
