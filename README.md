# LearnWords
A vocabulary trainer


I programmed this project as part of my OCA Java SE8 Programmer preparation training. 
The project is not finished and I am not planning to continue working on it. 

My main goal was to apply all the various aspects and capabilities of the Java language that we discussed during the course. I also tried out some other things 
that were not part of the course like password encryption, storing an encrypted password on a SQL database and verify login attempts using the stored password etc.

Also I tried to re-use as much code as possible (although I know there is potential for more) and to come up with some sort of application achitecture (using MVC design approach). 
Due to my limited experience this was a great challenge and learning opportunity for me to structure such a program and its classes and to come up with some sort of class structure and hierarchy.

I struggled a little with GUIs as I had no prior experience, so coding my GUIs including inheritance of GUI base designs (and making sure everything runs smooth) 
took much more time than anticipated. However, considering the amount of time available for this project, I was happy that I made this work.
I know it looks ugly but in a real world project I would leave this part to a skilled designer :)

Please feel free to leave any comments / suggestions.
